# outlook-beyondcompare-macro
Macro (VB6) to parse outlook email. Looks for FOLDER link and open folder comparison in beyond compare.

Expectation is that the folder contains **Baseline** and **Modified** folders for comparison. Versioning would be with (v#) such as **Baseline (v2)** and **Modified (v2)**. 

The latest file link in an email chain is taken.
